# AN-EXPERIMENTAL-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-ON-RPA-WITH-OPEN-SOURCE-OCR-ENGINES-2.0
Robotic Process Automation is a platform used to automate boring and repetitive computer processes 
using software bots so that humans could involve in tasks which include creativity and decision making 
which could not be done by robots. Optical Character Recognition takes out printed characters in an image and converts it to text. 
Google Tesseract OCR and Microsoft OCR were the commonly used OCR engines available in UiPath, a tool for Robotic Process Automation. 
Previously, we made a research on comparing those two open source OCR engine, there we made comparison on basic factors which included speed, 
hardware requirements, accuracy , but in that case, accuracy was been calculated manually which gave us results but with less precise, 
as it was a manual process to substitute scraped data to that formulas, In this research we’ve made results with 
more precision by performing a String comparison algorithm named, “Levenshtein Distance Algorithm” which is deployed in UiPath.
